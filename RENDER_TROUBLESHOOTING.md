# 🚀 Render Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## ⚠️ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: API Timeout Errors (15 seconds timeout exceeded)

**Symptoms:**
```
API Error: timeout of 15000ms exceeded
Home content fetch failed, using defaults
About content fetch failed, will use defaults for stats
```

**Root Causes:**
1. **Backend Service is Sleeping** (Render free tier)
2. **Missing Environment Variables**
3. **MongoDB Connection Failed**
4. **Backend Build/Start Failed**

---

## 🔧 Solutions

### Solution 1: Fix Sleeping Backend (Render Free Tier)

Render free tier puts services to sleep after **15 minutes of inactivity**. When a request comes in, it takes **30-50 seconds** to wake up.

**Quick Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Increased frontend API timeout from 15s to 60s in production
- ✅ Added retry logic for failed requests (max 2 retries)
- ✅ Better error messages in console

**Long-term Solutions:**
- Upgrade to Render paid tier ($7/month) - keeps service always active
- Use a service like [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) to ping your backend every 5-10 minutes
- Add a cron job to keep the service warm

---

### Solution 2: Verify Environment Variables on Render

**Required Environment Variables for Backend:**

Go to Render Dashboard → Your Backend Service → Environment

```bash
# REQUIRED
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/dbname?retryWrites=true&w=majority
DB_NAME=mspn_dev_db
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-minimum-32-characters-long
CORS_ORIGINS=https://new-159.vercel.app,https://your-custom-domain.com

# OPTIONAL
TRUST_PROXY=true
PORT=10000  # Render auto-sets this, usually don't need to override
```

**Required Environment Variables for Frontend (Vercel):**

Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables

```bash
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://mspn-dev.onrender.com/api
WDS_SOCKET_PORT=443
```

---

### Solution 3: Check Backend Logs on Render

1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Select your backend service
3. Click "Logs" tab
4. Look for these **GOOD** signs:
   ```
   ✅ MongoDB connected | DB: mspn_dev_db
   ✅ Super admin created successfully!
   INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:10000
   INFO: Application startup complete
   ```

5. Look for these **BAD** signs:
   ```
   ❌ MONGODB_URI is missing!
   ValueError: MONGODB_URI environment variable is required
   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'
   ```

**If you see errors:**
- Check environment variables are set
- Make sure MongoDB URI is correct
- Verify all dependencies are in requirements.txt

---

### Solution 4: MongoDB Connection Issues

**Symptoms:**
```
ERROR:database:❌ MONGODB_URI is missing!
pymongo.errors.ServerSelectionTimeoutError
```

**Fix:**
1. Make sure `MONGODB_URI` is set in Render environment variables
2. If using MongoDB Atlas:
   - Go to MongoDB Atlas → Network Access
   - Add `0.0.0.0/0` to IP whitelist (allow from anywhere)
   - Or add your Render service's outbound IP addresses
3. Verify connection string format:
   ```
   mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/dbname?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```
4. Make sure username/password don't have special characters (or URL encode them)

---

### Solution 5: CORS Errors

**Symptoms:**
```
Access to XMLHttpRequest blocked by CORS policy
```

**Fix:**
Update `CORS_ORIGINS` environment variable on Render to include your frontend URL:
```bash
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,https://new-159.vercel.app,https://www.your-domain.com
```

Then restart the backend service on Render.

---

## 🧪 Testing Your Deployment

### 1. Test Backend Health

Open in browser or use curl:
```bash
curl https://mspn-dev.onrender.com/api/
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{"message": "METECHQ API is running"}
```

### 2. Test Specific Endpoints

```bash
# Test content endpoint
curl https://mspn-dev.onrender.com/api/content/

# Test about endpoint
curl https://mspn-dev.onrender.com/api/about/

# Test projects endpoint
curl https://mspn-dev.onrender.com/api/projects/
```

### 3. Check Frontend Console

Open browser console (F12) and look for:
```
🔗 API Base URL: https://mspn-dev.onrender.com/api
[API Request] GET https://mspn-dev.onrender.com/api/content/
```

## 📝 Deployment Checklist

### Backend (Render):
- [ ] Service is created and deployed
- [ ] Environment variables are set (MONGODB_URI, DB_NAME, JWT_SECRET_KEY, CORS_ORIGINS)
- [ ] MongoDB connection is working
- [ ] Service is running (check logs for "Application startup complete")
- [ ] Health endpoint responds: `https://your-backend.onrender.com/api/`

### Frontend (Vercel):
- [ ] Project is deployed
- [ ] Environment variable `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` is set
- [ ] Build completed successfully
- [ ] Frontend loads without errors
- [ ] API calls reach the backend (check Network tab in browser)

### MongoDB Atlas:
- [ ] Database cluster is created
- [ ] Network access allows connections from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) or specific IPs
- [ ] Database user has read/write permissions
- [ ] Connection string is correct

---

## 🐛 Still Having Issues?

### Enable Detailed Logging

**Backend:** Check full logs on Render
**Frontend:** Open browser console (F12) → Console tab

Look for:
- Connection errors
- Timeout errors
- CORS errors
- 401/403 authentication errors
- 404 endpoint not found errors
- 500 server errors

### Common Error Messages and Fixes:

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `timeout of 15000ms exceeded` | Backend is sleeping, wait 30-50 seconds and refresh |
| `MONGODB_URI is missing` | Set environment variable on Render |
| `Network Error` | Check backend is running, verify URL is correct |
| `CORS policy` | Add frontend URL to CORS_ORIGINS on backend |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Check if admin/user is logged in |
| `404 Not Found` | Verify API endpoint exists and URL is correct |

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use Render's "Manual Deploy"** instead of auto-deploy while debugging
2. **Check logs immediately** after deployment to catch errors early
3. **Test endpoints with curl** before testing from frontend
4. **Keep a copy of working environment variables** in a secure location
5. **Use health check utilities** provided in the codebase to diagnose issues
6. **Monitor your MongoDB Atlas** usage to avoid quota limits

---

## 🔄 Quick Restart Steps

If things break, try this sequence:

1. **Restart Backend on Render:**
   - Go to Render Dashboard → Service → Manual Deploy → "Clear build cache & deploy"

2. **Redeploy Frontend on Vercel:**
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Project → Deployments → "Redeploy"

3. **Wait for Services to Start:**
   - Backend: 2-3 minutes
   - Frontend: 1-2 minutes

4. **Test Health Endpoint:**
   - `curl https://your-backend.onrender.com/api/`

5. **Load Frontend and Check Console:**
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Look for API request logs
